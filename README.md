# iot-module-template-rs

## What is iot-module-template-rs?
This `iot-module-template-rs` repository provides code to develop Rust based [Azure IoT modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-module-twins) for ICS_DeviceManagement. In comparison to [IoTEdge modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/module-development?view=iotedge-2020-11) these modules are not containerized and run natively on the device. In order to develop C/C++ based IoTEdge modules for ICS_DeviceManagement refer to the [iotedge-module-template](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/iotedge-module-template) repository.

## Template and example code
The [code](src/main.rs) of this template implements a very simple example which demonstrates the basic skeleton and boilerplate code necessary for initial implementation. To be able to easily check for successful module deployment the example uses module-twin functionality to report back all desired properties as reported properties. Thus you could define a desired property in the corresponding module-twin (e.g. in Azure portal or via [iot-explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-pnp/howto-use-iot-explorer)) and check if the same property is looped back as reported property afterwards.

## Platform integration
Both of the supported ICS_DeviceManagement targets - [yocto](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/ics-dm-os) and [simulator](https://github.com/ICS-DeviceManagement/simulator) - integrate the iot-module-template-rs and serve as an example for device integration.

## Module identity creation in Azure iot-hub
In order to enable the communication between module and cloud a module identity needs to be created in Azure iot-hub.

### Module identity creation via Azure Identity Service (AIS)
In case your device works with integrated [AIS](https://azure.github.io/iot-identity-service/), the module creation will be managed automatically on demand. ICS_DeviceManagement yocto layer and simulator support AIS by default.

### Module identity creation via powershell script
In case the device doesn't come with AIS you have to create module identity manually or by script support. For that purpose this repository provides a powershell [script](script/Add-ModuleToAllDevicesInIotHub.ps1) which creates a module identity for newly created devices. In order to automate that process these steps must be followed:
1. Create an Azure function powershell app either in portal or from [VSC](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-powershell).
2. [Create an event subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-event-grid) for the `Device Created` event in your iot-hub. Select the Azure function as endpoint.
3. Adapt the [script](script/Add-ModuleToAllDevicesInIotHub.ps1) to your needs:
   1. IOT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING: set to your specific iot-hub connection string
   2. MODULE_NAME: set to your specific module name that will be used as identity
   3. Create TAGS and PROPERTIES in `CreateAndPopulateModuleForDevice` function in order to define initial module-twin settings
